                    <div class="text">Mantis shrimp have some of the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom.
                        They can see polarized light and have 16 color-receptive cones (humans have only three). Their vision is so advanced that they can perceive details and nuances that are invisible to humans.</div>

                    <div class="text">Mantis shrimp can live for over 20 years and are known for their complex social behaviors, including intricate mating rituals and territorial disputes. They communicate using body language, color changes, and even produce low-frequency sounds. In some species, they are also known to be monogamous, forming long-term pair bonds with a single mate.</div>

                    <div class="text">Mantis shrimp are known for their powerful, lightning-fast punches, which can strike with the speed of a bullet (up to 23 m/s or 50 mph). This punch is so forceful that it can break the shells of prey, like crabs and mollusks, and even shatter aquarium glass.</div>

                    <div class="text">There are two main types of mantis shrimp: "spearers" and "smashers." Spearers have sharp appendages that they use to impale soft-bodied prey, while smashers have club-like appendages that they use to bludgeon hard-shelled prey. Both types deliver extremely powerful strikes, but they use different techniques to catch their food.</div>
